N-dimensional interpolation based on smoothed inverse-distance weighting of nearest grid points. Written and updated by [Carlos E. Munoz Romero](https://github.com/munozcar/) 2019.

Example test provided uses [ATMO](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yz94usAAiXtnLR0yoq-qkuhegRrI4u4B) grid to interpolate an exoplanetary transmission spectrum.

See wiki for details on grid organization and best practices.
